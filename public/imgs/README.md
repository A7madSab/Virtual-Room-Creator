# Homathon - Virtual Room Creator Team

Homathon is a #StayAtHome online hackathon set up to face the challenges Individuals, Communities, Businesses, and Governments are facing as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.

# Problem 

Due to Covid-19, shifting to online educational platforms is <strong>imminent</strong>, trying to do this shift while maintaining the same level of education is an <strong>unprecedented</strong> challenge.

# Solution & Goal

VRC is a Virtual Reality Environment/Room Generator: We are a tool that enables tutors/teachers to create more appealing educational content, in the form of an easily sharable VR environment that can create an atmosphere that can't be replicated in an online or even onsite lectures. We aim to improve the quality of the lectures online, by placing the student in the middle of a VR scene, surrounded by the course's content.
